h1. Penetrate for iOS

This app was rejected (for obvious reasons) on the Apple's App Store, so I'm opening the (simple) sources here.


Penetrate for iOS maps network names into the default keys of known routers:
* SpeedTouch, Thomson, Orange, DMax, BBox, Infinitum, Otenet, Cyta
* DLink
* Pirelli Discus

h2. How to build

After you checkout the sources, please run the included script ./download_database.sh that will download the default password database. I cannot include this on github's account due to size issues.

After that, you can open the project on XCode and build it yourself.

Have fun
