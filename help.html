    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Penetrate for iPhone maps network names into the default keys of known routers:
      <ul>
        <li>SpeedTouch, Thomson, Orange, DMax, BBox, Infinitum, Otenet, Cyta</li>
        <li>DLink</li>
        <li>Pirelli Discus</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <p>Copy the wireless network name (SSID) and write it on the search box. If any results are found, simply click on a result cell and the password is copied to the device's pasteboard. You can then try it on the network password dialog</p>
    <p>Since this app is compatible with iOS 4, you can always return to it to try a different password, without writing the network name again.</p>

    <p><strong>Remeber: the app works offline, no internet connection required!</strong></p>
